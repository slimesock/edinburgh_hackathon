## Introduction

The hackathon is designed to give you hands-on experience with:  
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Using Whisper to transcribe speech.  
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilizing Neuphonic's API for voice synthesis.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Building conversational AI with lightweight, high-performance models.

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You will need **Python3.8+**, **pip** and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with [llama3.1:latest](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1)
installed.

Ollama is a tool that you can use to run LLMs locally on your laptop.
To download Ollama, use the link above. 
Then start the application, and enter the command `ollama run llama3.1:latest` in your terminal
to download and run the `llama:3.1 8b` model locally.

### Installation

Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuphonic/edinburgh_hackathon.git
cd edinburgh_hackathon
```

Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code Overview

### Whisper ASR

The **Whisper ASR** module converts real-time speech to text.

**Key Functionality:**  
- `speech_recognition()`: Streams and transcribes audio in real-time, detecting sentence completions.

Test this out with
```python
python whisper_speech_recognition.py
```

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

The **Text-to-Speech** module leverages Neuphonic’s API for generating high-quality audio.

**Key Functionality:**  
- `neuphonic_tts(input_text)`: Converts input text into speech and plays it.

Test this out with
```python
python neuphonic_texttospeech.py
```

### Large Language Model (LLM)

The **LLM** module provides conversational responses using a lightweight language model.

**Key Functionality:**  
- `language_model_chat(user_input)`: Processes conversational context and generates concise, friendly replies.

Test this out with
```python
python ollama_llm.py
```

### Main Program
The **Main** program integrates ASR, TTS, and LLM for a seamless conversational experience: 
1. Transcribe speech, generate responses, and convert them to speech.  
2. Engage in real-time conversation.

---

## How to Run

1. **Start the main program**:  
```bash
   python main.py
```

---

## Interaction Flow

1. Speak into the microphone, and the system will transcribe your speech in real time.
2. The transcribed text is sent to the LLM to generate a response.
3. The response is converted to speech using the TTS module and played back to you.
4. Repeat the process to continue the conversation.

## Challenges & Ideas

### Challenges
- **Real-time performance**: Ensure smooth, low-latency interactions.  
- **Robustness**: Handle varied accents, speech rates, and noisy environments.  

### Project Ideas
- **Virtual Assistant**: Build a personalized voice assistant.  
- **Interactive Learning**: Develop a language learning app.  
- **Accessibility Tool**: Create tools for users with disabilities.

## Contribution Guidelines

All contributions during the hackathon should be:  
- Clearly documented.  
- Tested to ensure compatibility with the main system.
